### Introduction to Computer Vision

**Computer Vision (CV) is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables machines to interpret and process visual data from the world, such as images and videos. It aims to replicate human vision capabilities by extracting meaningful information from visual inputs and making decisions based on that data.**

### Key Goals of Computer Vision:

- Recognition: Identifying objects, people, or scenes in images.

- Detection: Locating objects within an image or video.

- Reconstruction: Creating 3D models from 2D images.

- Understanding: Interpreting the context and meaning of visual data.

### Applications of Computer Vision:

- Autonomous vehicles (e.g., self-driving cars).

- Facial recognition and biometrics.

- Medical imaging and diagnostics.

- Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR).

- Industrial automation and quality control.
