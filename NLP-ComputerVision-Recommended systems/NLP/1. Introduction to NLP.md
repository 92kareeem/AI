### Introduction to NLP
**Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) and computational linguistics that focuses on enabling machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language. It bridges the gap between human communication and computer understanding, allowing machines to perform tasks like translation, sentiment analysis, summarization, and more.**

**Key Goals of NLP:**

--> Understanding: Extracting meaning from text or speech.

--> Generation: Producing human-like text or speech.

--> Interaction: Enabling seamless communication between humans and machines.

**Applications of NLP:**

- Chatbots and virtual assistants (e.g., Siri, Alexa).

- Sentiment analysis for customer feedback.

- Machine translation (e.g., Google Translate).

- Text summarization and information extraction.

- Spam detection and content moderation.
