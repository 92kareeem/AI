**NLP involves several key components that work together to process and analyze language:**


### a. Tokenization

Splitting text into smaller units like words, phrases, or sentences.

Example: "I love NLP!" → ["I", "love", "NLP", "!"].

### b. Stemming and Lemmatization

- Stemming: Reducing words to their root form (e.g., "running" → "run").

- Lemmatization: Converting words to their base or dictionary form (e.g., "better" → "good").

### c. Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging

Assigning grammatical tags to words (e.g., noun, verb, adjective).

Example: "She runs" → ["She" (pronoun), "runs" (verb)].

#### d. Named Entity Recognition (NER)

Identifying and classifying entities like names, dates, and locations.

Example: "Apple is based in Cupertino." → ["Apple" (organization), "Cupertino" (location)].

#### e. Syntax and Parsing

Analyzing sentence structure to understand grammatical relationships.

Example: Parsing "The cat sat on the mat" to identify subject, verb, and object.

#### f. Semantic Analysis

Understanding the meaning of words and sentences.

Example: Resolving ambiguity in "He went to the bank" (financial institution vs. riverbank).

#### g. Discourse Integration

Understanding how sentences relate to each other in a larger text.

Example: Resolving pronouns like "it" or "they" in a paragraph.
