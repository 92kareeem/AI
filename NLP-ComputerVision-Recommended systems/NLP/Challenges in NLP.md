### Challenges in NLP
NLP faces several challenges due to the complexity and nuances of human language:

### a. Ambiguity

Words or phrases can have multiple meanings (e.g., "bank," "bat").

Context is required to resolve ambiguity.

### b. Sarcasm and Irony

Detecting sarcasm or irony in text is difficult for machines.

Example: "Great, another Monday!" (negative sentiment despite positive words).

### c. Idioms and Cultural Nuances

Phrases like "kick the bucket" (meaning "to die") are hard to interpret literally.

### d. Lack of Context

Short texts (e.g., tweets) often lack sufficient context for accurate analysis.

### e. Multilingualism

Handling multiple languages, dialects, and scripts adds complexity.

### f. Data Sparsity

Rare words or phrases may not have enough data for accurate modeling.
